			<h1>ABOUT</h1>

			<section>
				<!-- <h4>Mission Statement</h4> -->
				<p>I am a front-end developer with a design background, a creative eye and a sucker for all things aesthetic. With almost 3 years experience in front-end development I offer skills in translating design mock ups into responsive pages; building landing pages and HTML eDMS; and the ability to add interactive experiences to static designs. I have a strong work ethic and an eagerness to keep learning new skills amongst an ever-changing technological and digital world.</p><br><br>

				<h2>BACKGROUND: Web, Photography & Design things</h2>

				<p>I once sailed the Caribbean and Baltic Seas as a photographer with a fresh Graphic Design Cert and Photomedia Degree billowing in the wind behind me. These days I’m working and playing in the world wide web of HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I’m constantly learning new skills and right now I am building, designing and refining this site (from scratch!) and seeing where the balance of new and old skills meet. <br>For some of my photography work visit <a href="https://www.tina-lynch.com/">here</a>... or <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tinamarielynch">Flickr</a> is gathering digital dust.</p>

				<h2>EXPERIENCE/WORK HISTORY</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><h3>AAT Kings <span class="weight300">Web Content Publisher | Nov 2015 - Present</span></h3>
						<p>My current role as a web content publisher has evolved in the the skill set of a Front End Developer and is my biggest achievement and also the kick start to the (web) development of my career. With no prior coding skills, I was given a opportunity and the only way to succeed was to absorb and learn everything that got thrown my way. Today, I am part of the AAT Kings web team and my most recent project and highlight is my involvement in the re-design of the AAT Kings website. I have been heavily involved in bringing the new design to live via version control with HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP. Currently in its final stages, aatkings.com will be a fully responsive, enhanced and modern website. </p>
						<p>Other projects I have undertaken vary from mobile optimisation, landing page creation (mock up to hard-code execution); and building functional and optimised eDMs with thorough testing across responsive platforms (desktop, mobile, tablet via resources like Litmus and BrowserStack). An achievement was further developing and implementing the eDMs into templates in Exact Target (SalesForce Marketing Cloud) for the wider Marketing Team to use, thus allowing the Web Team more time to focus on website development, functionality and enhancements.</p>
						<p>Further duties include maintaining and enhancing content/product load and working closely with internal stakeholders to ensure consistency and adherence to company guidelines. Extended duties and capabilities include video editing, SEO projects, knowledge of internal systems and documentation manuals for both consumer and internal stakeholders.</p>
						<p>Originally in Sales/Reservations, I moved into the Web Team through my self initiated request to shadow the Design Manager to gain exposure and experience in the Design and Marketing aspects of the business.</p>

		<!-- 	<p>My claim to fame, my biggest acheivement and the kick start to the (web) development of my career. Sometimes someone takes a chance on you and you the only way to succeed is to ask a million questions and to absorb everything that gets thrown your way.
						you just need to be given a chance and when you do you need to jump in and absorb everything you can. 
						With no coding skills whatsoever, I started with indepth sales and product knowledge of the brand, and a dusty Photomedia Degree and Graphic Design certificate IV behind me. 
						Today I am part of the AAT Kings web team and I am proficient in HTML/CSS and intermediate JavaScript/JQuery. I used to hand code eDM's, and in turn have helped implement eDM templates in SalesForce.
					I've played with Version Control and taken on mobile optimisation projects with thorough testing across responsive platforms.
					My photography and graphic design skills have not gone to waste with creating mock ups of web pages and optimising images and banners for the web.</p>

 					<h4>VOLUNTEER & WORK EXPERIENCE</h4>
 					<ul>
 						<li><h6>AAT Kings Design Team | October - December 2015</h6>
							<p>I was exposed to the procedures involved in the design process of brochure and marketing collateral production for AAT Kings products whilst shadowing the AAT Kings Design Executive for requested work expereince and career progression. I came to understand how files were managed; how design and print schedules were maintained; the process to overcome/resolve any design issues that may occur; and the importance of internal relationships between different departments for a cohesive production. From my enthusiasm to shadow the design team out of normal working hours, I was then able to move into my current position as Web Content Publisher.</p>
						</li>
 						<li><h6>Macarthur Combined Churches Christmas Lunch	| December 2015</h6>
							<p>I volunteered at the annual event which is held for the disadvantaged, disabled and for people in the community who may be spending Christmas Day alone. The event helps to give those with financial hardship the opportunity to celebrate with presents and meals which many take for granted during the festive season. This event brought a strong sense of community and support to many families as meals and presents were celebrated with those of financial hardship.</p>
