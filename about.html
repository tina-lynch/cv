				<h3>ABOUT</h3>

					<h4>Photography, Design & Web things</h4>
					<p>I used to take a lot of photos, these days my world is learning about all things web. <br>As I work on polishing my web & coding talent, I am building, designing and refining this site and seeing where the balance of new and old skills meet. In the mean time some of my photography & design work are here ((wix) or gathering digital dust on Flickr.</p>

					<h4>Work Experience</h4>
					<!-- <p>My claim to fame, my biggest acheivement and the kick start to the (web) development of my career. Sometimes someone takes a chance on you and you the only way to succeed is to ask a million questions and to absorb everything that gets thrown your way.
						you just need to be given a chance and when you do you need to jump in and absorb everything you can. 
						With no coding skills whatsoever, I started with indepth sales and product knowledge of the brand, and a dusty Photomedia Degree and Graphic Design certificate IV behind me. 
						Today I am part of the AAT Kings web team and I am proficient in HTML/CSS and intermediate JavaScript/JQuery. I used to hand code eDM's, and in turn have helped implement eDM templates in SalesForce.
					I've played with Version Control and taken on mobile optimisation projects with thorough testing across responsive platforms.
					My photography and graphic design skills have not gone to waste with creating mock ups of web pages and optimising images and banners for the web.

					 <p>My current role as a web content publisher is my biggest acheivement and was the kick start to the (web) development of my career. With no prior coding skills, I was given a chance and the only way to succeed was to ask a million questions and absorb everything that got thrown my way.
					Today I am part of the AAT Kings web team and I am proficient in HTML/CSS and intermediate JavaScript/JQuery. I used to frequently create/code eDM's, and in turn helped implement eDM templates in SalesForce for the wider team. I've played with Version Control and taken on mobile optimisation projects with thorough testing across responsive platforms. My photography and graphic design skills have not gone to waste with creating mock ups of web pages and optimising images and creating banners for the AAT Kings website.</p>
