			<h1>ABOUT</h1>

			<section>
				<p>I once cruised the Caribbean and Baltic Seas as a photographer.</p><br><br><br>
				<p>These days I’m working and playing in the world wide web of HTML, CSS & jQuery. I’m constantly learning new skills and right now I am building, designing and refining this site (from scratch!) and seeing where the balance of new and old skills meet.</p>
				<p>With almost 3 years experience in front-end development I offer skills in translating design mock ups into responsive pages; building landing pages + HTML eDMS; and the ability to add interactive experiences to static designs. I have a strong work ethic and an eagerness to keep learning new skills amongst an ever-changing digital world.</p><br><br>

				<h2>EXPERIENCE/WORK HISTORY</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><h3>AAT Kings <span class="weight300">Web Content Publisher | Nov 2015 - Present</span></h3>
						<p>My current role as a web content publisher has evolved in the the skill set of a Front End Developer and is my biggest achievement and also the kick start to the (web) development of my career. With no prior coding skills, I was given a opportunity, and the only way to succeed was to absorb and learn everything that got thrown my way. Today, I am part of the AAT Kings web team and my most recent project and highlight is my involvement in the re-design of the AAT Kings website. I have been heavily involved in bringing the new design to life via version control with HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP. Currently in its final stages, aatkings.com will be a fully responsive, enhanced and modern website. </p>
						<p>Anther project I undertook was building functional and optimised eDMs with thorough cv across responsive platforms (desktop, mobile, tablet) and implementing them into templates in Exact Target (Marketing Cloud) for the wider Marketing Team to use and distribute. (They can now create and edit fortnightly eDMs without my assistance!) This acheivement allowed the Web Team more time to focus on website development, functionality and enhancements.</p>
						<p>Further duties vary from mobile optimisation, landing page creation (mock up to hard-code execution), maintaining and enhancing content/product load and working closely with internal stakeholders to ensure consistency and adherence to company guidelines. Extended duties and capabilities include video editing, SEO projects, knowledge of internal systems and documentation manuals for both consumer and internal stakeholders.</p>

 				<h4>VOLUNTEER & WORK EXPERIENCE</h4>
 				<ul class="vol-wx">
 					<li><h6>AAT Kings Design Team <span class="italic"> &raquo;&nbsp;September&nbsp;-&nbsp;November 2015</span></h6>
 						<p>Originally in Sales/Reservations, I self initiated a request to shadow and sit with the Design Manager to gain exposure and experience in Design and Marketing aspects of the business.<br>I was exposed to the procedures design processes of brochure, marketing collateral and coach livery design. I came to understand how files were managed; how design and print schedules were maintained; the process to overcome/resolve any design issues that may occur; and the importance of internal relationships between different departments for a cohesive production. From my enthusiasm to shadow the design team out of normal working hours, I was able to move into my current position as Web Content Publisher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					</li>
 					<li><h6>Macarthur Combined Churches Christmas&nbsp;Lunch <span class="italic"> &raquo;&nbsp;December 2015</span></h6>
						<p>I volunteered at the annual event which is held for the disadvantaged, disabled and for people in the community who may be spending Christmas Day alone. The event helps to give those with financial hardship the opportunity to celebrate with presents and meals which many take for granted during the festive season. This event brought a strong sense of community and support to many families as meals and presents were celebrated with those of financial hardship.</p>
